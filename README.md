2. Extract the Files


After downloading, extract the ZIP file (using a program such as WinRAR)to a convenient location on your computer, Preferably to:

C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Desktop, or

directly to C:\

The extraction process will create a folder named DELTA, resulting in a directory such as:

C:\Users\<YourUserName>\DELTA, or

C:\DELTA

This folder contains all the DELTA dataset files and images required to run the Intkey software.

3. Open in Intkey


Launch Intkey (part of the Open DELTA software) by double-clicking the file intkey.lnk inside the DELTA folder.
Once Intkey is open, load the dataset and begin exploring and identifying Restionaceae species interactively.

4. Understanding the Intkey Interface

The Intkey interface consists of four distinct windows, each performing a specific function during the process of interactive identification.

![Illustrated step 5](illustrated%20images/Fig5.png) 

Best Characters (Top Left)
Displays all the available diagnostic characters (for example, culm colour, fruit type, or anther length) that can be used for identification.
When a character is selected and scored, Intkey uses that information to progressively narrow down the possible taxa.

Used Characters (Bottom Left)
Once a character has been selected and scored, it automatically moves from the Best Characters list to the Used Characters window.
This helps the user keep track of which features have already been applied during the identification process.

Remaining Taxa (Top Right)
Shows all taxa that still match the information entered so far.
As additional characters are scored, the number of remaining taxa decreases, leading to a more precise identification.

Eliminated Taxa (Bottom Right)
Lists the taxa that no longer match the scored characters.
As the user refines the identification through further scoring, non-matching species are automatically moved into this section.

When you click on any character, several related images may appear automatically.
These images illustrate the corresponding character states and provide visual guidance to assist with accurate scoring and interpretation.
